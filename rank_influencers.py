  * Pull in influencers for bitcoin
  * sort them by engagement (retweets, likes etc)
  * store the top 5 in mongo in some "influencers" collection with the type of coin they relate to.

  Note: Later we can do more analysis of how good they are based on what they post, but just start small.
  SEE: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/minimongo for how to work with mongo

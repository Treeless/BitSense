  * here you need to pull all the prices for the last week
  * Store those prices in mongoDB in some sort of model. SEE here: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/minimongo
  * Notes:
  ** Ensure that you aren't putting in duplicate data, basically you need to make a unique index on each price entry based on the date. Google is your friend for this.

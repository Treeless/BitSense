# Cryptosense Twitter BOT

Basically created a twitter bot that goes through this process:
* [DONE] Searches twitter for influencers that post about bitcoin
* [DONE] Stores those influencers
* [DONE] Finds all the influencer's tweets from all time that are about bitcoin
* [TODO] Checks how those tweets via sentiment and timeframe relate to the bitcoin price
* [TODO] Ranks the influencers based on their tweets relation to the price (the more correct the sentiment to price increase, the better the score)
* [TODO] The highest scoring influencers for the day, will have their relevant content retweeted.
